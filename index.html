                    Hello! My name is Zane, or as this portfolio suggests, BidoofsDad! (The name is derived from an
                    inside joke between
                    a good friend, my wife, and I) Anyhow, I like to think of myself as a very easy going person, who
                    just likes getting along
                    with others! I've always had the view, that life is so much easier when you're just kind to people,
                    so that is something I've
                    always lived by!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love spending time with my wife and our 4 kitties, we're always keeping busy, whether it be
                    spening time with friends, spending
                    time outdoors, or just relaxing and streaming some movies or shows. Some of my favorite hobbies are,
                    getting out in nature
                    (when weather permits of course, thanks Minnesota), long-boarding with my wife, and skateboarding!
                    Some other
                    passions/hobbies I love are video games and movies (especially the horror genre for both). I'm
                    always searching for
                    things to learn, as more knowledge never hurt anyone! I'm not sure of what else to mention, so I
                    suppose, welcome to
                    my portfolio!
