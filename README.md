# BidoofsDad's Portfolio

## Description

So when I started out, I wanted to try and match the layout of the provided gif inside of the challenge. I think all in all, I was able to get it to be pretty close! Obviously as of right now, I don't have any projects to link to my portfolio, so instead I just made them all pictures of my cats (the buttons are still interactable though as well as they all have their names displayed within the image, with a background color behind each). I was originally going to just add different photos of my favorite hobbies, but then I thought, "I got some really cute cats" and so the choice was made!

One thing that I added to the code, that I was pretty proud of (and thought was pretty cool) was making the subtitle text transparent, allowing the background image to shine through and display what the actual text is! I was also a fan of getting that vertical line in there as well, I feel it just kind of just makes the page a little more tidy. I'm also a fan of the color pallet that I chose, it gives off a neon blue at night kind of feeling (thanks to my wife for helping me pick out those colors!)

## Issues

I ran into quite a few issues while making the webpage though, such as dealing with flex boxes (which I'm still trying to learn better) as well as certain things just not sitting where I wanted them to, no matter how I adjusted them.

Some issues that are still prevalent on the page, are as follows;

* I couldn't get an 'inset' value to work when clicking on one of the picture links (presumably due to it being an 'img src' and not just a background-image inside of a div).

* Going off of the image issue, they appear not lined up, due to each image having different dimensions, however I did set the 'flex-basis' to a fixed width, which helped sharpen it up a bit.

* I also had trouble keeping the vertical lines in line with each other. I was able to keep the 'About Me" and the 'Work' lines inline, but couldn't get the 'Resume' line to cooperate unfortunately.

* Going off of the 'Resume' line, the small paragraph next to it is not in line. I noticed that if I added a bunch of text to it, then it would appear correctly, but with the small amount that is there, it just didn't want to work. I tried messing around with the margins as well, but then that just seemed to affect other properties when shrinking the page.

* A small issue I couldn't find the solution to was in the footer. When adding a border to it, it seems it wanted to double up and add two. In the end I actually liked the look of the double line, but I would still like to know how to change that.

* The last thing was also a little minor, but again I would like to know how to fix it. I couldn't seem to get the 'header', 'background image' nor the 'footer' to stretch all the way across the screen, instead they have just a small border around them consisting of the 'body' background color. It still looks fine, but I would like to fix that for future endeavors.
